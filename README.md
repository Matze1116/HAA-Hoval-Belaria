# Hoval Belaria 13 Heat Pump Integration for Home Assistant

This repository contains my custom configuration for integrating a **Hoval Belaria 13 air-to-water heat pump** into **Home Assistant**.  

I use a **Modbus module** installed in the Hoval Belaria 13 to access and read datapoints from the heat pump. These datapoints are then exposed in Home Assistant for monitoring and control.  

## Features
- Reads key datapoints via Modbus  
- Provides real-time values in Home Assistant  
- Easy to adapt for similar Hoval devices  

## Requirements
- Hoval Belaria 13 with Modbus module  
- Home Assistant setup with Modbus integration enabled
